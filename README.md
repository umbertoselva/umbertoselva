### AI Consulting Freelancing Services

#### GenAI Applications and APIs
End-to-end design, development, deployment and optimization of scalable, event-driven architecture-based AI applications, APIs, MCP servers and microservices, using modern cloud-native strategies and covering everything from proof of concept to MVP to production-ready systems.
#### Chatbots
LLM-powered conversational assistants that know your company data, provide reliable answers, and leverage user profiling and custom memory strategies, available 24x7 for customer service, internal support, or lead qualification.
#### AI Agents and Workflows
Intelligent agents that can reason, retrieve information, use tools, execute multi-step tasks, and make smart decisions without human input, built with type-safe structured output and function-calling techniques, following state-of-the-art chain of responsibility architecture guidelines for orchestration, routing, parallelization, etc. to handle complex workflows and save your team time and effort.
#### Data and Document Processing
Automated and intelligent pipelines for extraction, parsing, classification, and labelling and reformatting of data from structured and unstructured sources (PDFs, invoices, legal documents, reports, tables, databases, etc.), cutting down manual repetitive work and improving accuracy.
#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipelines
Scalable custom retrieval systems leveraging vector databases, semantic search (embeddings), keyword-based and hybrid search, BM25, reranking, and filtering, on top of custom chunking strategies, to reduce hallucination and improve factual grounding of LLM output.
#### Evaluation and Optimization Pipelines
Design of automated testing pipelines for continuous performance optimization of your AI system, focusing on output relevance, faithfulness, context precision, context recall, or custom metrics, using state-of-the-art tools, LLM-as-judge, human-in-the-loop, and domain expert and user feedback strategies.
#### Prompt Engineering
Structured, modular, and model-specific prompt design using techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, iterative, chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought, self-reflection, dynamic-template and meta-prompting, temperature adjustment, and tool-based augmentation to make sure your LLMs do exactly what you want them to do.
#### Strategic Guidance and Training
Strategic guidance on how to integrate AI into your business and company workflows, transform your ideas into feasible products, discover new opportunities, evaluate cost-performance tradeoffs, and organize hands-on tutoring so that your team can use AI tools with confidence.

### Portfolio 

Here's an overview of the kind of projects that I have worked on in the last two years at [pharmazie.com](https://www.pharmazie.com):

#### ðŸ”¬  AI Agentic System
I built an AI Agent system (API) to leverage pharmaceutical data from a number of databases in support of conversational assistants. <br />
[Tech: Python, LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, FastAPI, Voiceflow, AWS, etc.]

#### ðŸ”­  Custom RAG Pipelines
I developed custom Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and (textual / tabular) data extraction pipelines for specific document types (PDFs, webpages, etc.) to provide conversational assistants with reliable data from pharmaceutical documentation. <br />
[Tech: Python, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Unstructured, FastAPI, Streamlit, AWS, etc.]

#### ðŸ§¬  Data Extraction to Template Pipelines
I developed custom AI pipelines to extract data from pharmaceutical documentation and databases, and format it into custom templates, tailored to our customers' needs. <br />
[Tech: Python, LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Unstructured, FastAPI, AWS, etc.]

#### ðŸ‘¾  Chatbot | Conversation Design
I designed conversation workflows, widgets and front-end interfaces to interact with our back-end AI applications (RAG, Agents, etc.). <br />
[Tech: Voiceflow, Botpress, Streamlit, Python, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI, AWS, etc.]


### Earlier Portfolio (2020-2022)

#### ðŸŽ¥  Fine-tuning BERT with TensorFlow for NER-based Sentiment Analysis (2022)
[NLP, ML, Data Science] [[Notebooks](https://github.com/umbertoselva/NER-based-Sentiment-Analysis)] <br />
A Data Science project in which I combine NER-extraction with spaCy and fine-tuning a BERT model with TensorFlow to perform sentiment analysis on a real-world movie review dataset extracted from the popular "I Just Watched" subreddit with the goal of finding out which actors are most popular among the subreddit users (spoiler: it was Tom Hanks!). <br />
[Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, spaCy, Pandas, Huggingface]

#### ðŸ“Š  Exploratory Data Analysis and House Price Prediction with custom utils (2022)
[Data Science, ML] [[Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/umbertoselva/House_Price_EDA_Regression/blob/main/House_Price_EDA_Regression.ipynb?flush_cache=true)][[Github repo](https://github.com/umbertoselva/House_Price_EDA_Regression)] <br />
A step-by-step example of how to apply Data Science to a Regression task. The goal is to fit a Machine Learning model to predict the price of residential houses on the basis of a large dataset containing a variety of explanatory variables (from the living area squared meters to the number of bedrooms). By employing a number of [custom Python utils](https://github.com/umbertoselva/House_Price_EDA_Regression/blob/main/ds_utils.py), I conduct exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature selection, model design, training, evaluation and model explainability. <br />
[Tech: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sci-kit Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Statsmodels, Scipy.stats, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Lime]

#### ðŸŽµ  The Sanskrit Meterscan (2020)
[NLP, Web App Back-end Development] [[Website](http://www.sanskritmeterscan.net/about)][[Github repo](https://github.com/umbertoselva/sanskritmeterscan)] <br />
A digital humanities web tool, built with Python's back-end framework Flask, that automates the metrical scansion of Sanskrit and Vedic texts. The app has been online since 2020 and is used by academic scholars in the fields of Indology, Indo-Iranian Philology and Historical Linguistics. <br />
[Tech: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript]
