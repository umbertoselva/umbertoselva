### About me

I am a former post-doctoral researcher and lecturer with a Phd in Linguistics from Leiden University in the Netherlands. After a career in academia, I trained and freelanced as an NLP specialist, acquiring a broad expertise across Machine Learning and Data Science, with a solid foundation in Software Development. I am currently working as an **AI Engineer** and I specialize in designing LLM-powered solutions and prompt engineering for a web platform in the pharmaceutical sector. I continue to offer freelancing services.

### Portfolio (Last update 2022)

#### ðŸŽ¥  Fine-tuning BERT with TensorFlow for NER-based Sentiment Analysis (2022)
[NLP, ML, Data Science] [[Notebooks](https://github.com/umbertoselva/NER-based-Sentiment-Analysis)] <br />
A Data Science project in which I combine NER-extraction with spaCy and fine-tuning a BERT model with TensorFlow to perform sentiment analysis on a real-world movie review dataset extracted from the popular "I Just Watched" subreddit with the goal of finding out which actors are most popular among the subreddit users (spoiler: it was Tom Hanks!). <br />
[Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, spaCy, Pandas, Huggingface]

#### ðŸ“Š  Exploratory Data Analysis and House Price Prediction with custom utils (2022)
[Data Science, ML] [[Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/umbertoselva/House_Price_EDA_Regression/blob/main/House_Price_EDA_Regression.ipynb?flush_cache=true)][[Github repo](https://github.com/umbertoselva/House_Price_EDA_Regression)] <br />
A step-by-step example of how to apply Data Science to a Regression task. The goal is to fit a Machine Learning model to predict the price of residential houses on the basis of a large dataset containing a variety of explanatory variables (from the living area squared meters to the number of bedrooms). By employing a number of [custom Python utils](https://github.com/umbertoselva/House_Price_EDA_Regression/blob/main/ds_utils.py), I conduct exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature selection, model design, training, evaluation and model explainability. <br />
[Tech: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sci-kit Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Statsmodels, Scipy.stats, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Lime]

#### ðŸŽµ  The Sanskrit Meterscan (2020)
[NLP, Web App Back-end Development] [[Website](http://www.sanskritmeterscan.net/about)][[Github repo](https://github.com/umbertoselva/sanskritmeterscan)] <br />
A digital humanities web tool, built with Python's back-end framework Flask, that automates the metrical scansion of Sanskrit and Vedic texts. The app has been online since 2020 and is used by academic scholars in the fields of Indology, Indo-Iranian Philology and Historical Linguistics. <br />
[Tech: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript]
